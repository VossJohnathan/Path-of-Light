<h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana.</h2>

Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side with palms up.
Close your eyes and breath slowly bet deeply.
Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away.

Place your hands in a prayers position.
Be grateful for all that you have in life.
Namaste.</p>
